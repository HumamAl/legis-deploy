Realistic metric ranges: deployment duration 45-120 seconds, health check latency 80-250ms, SQLite DB size 2-15MB after seeding. Edge cases in mock data: failed deployment due to missing ANTHROPIC_API_KEY, health check timeout on /api/generate endpoint, DB path misconfigured (relative vs. absolute), session secret set to placeholder value. Real tools this domain uses: Railway CLI (railway up, railway logs), Render dashboard, Vercel activity logs, Datadog APM, Docker inspect, curl health checks. The app itself is a legislative document generation platform powered by Anthropic Claude — document types include bill drafts and advocacy documents, exported as DOCX. This vocabulary (bill draft, advocacy document, DOCX export, site-wide password protection) should appear in mock data to make the deployment context feel authentic."

## Analysis Notes

### Domain Classification Reasoning

This job sits at the intersection of `tech` (Node.js/Express, deployment infrastructure) and potentially `compliance` (legislative document generation, NDA requirements). The primary domain is `tech` because:

- The scope of work is purely infrastructure: deploy, configure, verify, document
- The client's vocabulary is DevOps-centric throughout
- The demo should simulate a deployment monitoring/verification dashboard — a DevOps artifact
- The legislative document generation is the app being deployed, not the feature being built

The `tech` domain with `data-dense` aesthetic correctly maps per the routing table: "DevOps / Monitoring -> Data-Dense (primary)".

### Aesthetic Reasoning: Why Data-Dense, Not Linear

Both `linear` and `data-dense` are valid for `tech` domain. The deciding signals:

1. **Nature of the work**: Deployment monitoring, health checks, log tailing — these are operational tasks that map to Grafana/Datadog visual language, not Linear.app or Notion
2. **Demo composition**: The dashboard shows deployment status, env var checklist, health check results, setup logs — all data-dense information types (status grids, log lines, metric bars)
3. **Client communication style**: Numbered scope, explicit exclusions, verification checklist — operational thinker, not a design-focused founder
4. **`linear` is the "dev tools / SaaS" aesthetic**; `data-dense` is the "monitoring / ops" aesthetic. This is monitoring work.

### Demo Concept: Deployment Verification Dashboard

The demo should simulate what a DevOps engineer sees when verifying a production deployment. Concrete feature pages:

- **Deployment Overview** (dashboard): Live deployment status card, env var configuration checklist (12 variables shown with masked values + status), uptime/response time metrics, 30-day deployment history chart
- **Env Config**: Table of all env vars from .env.example (ANTHROPIC_API_KEY, SESSION_SECRET, SITE_PASSWORD, DATABASE_PATH), with status badges (Configured / Missing / Using Default), masked values, edit simulation
- **Setup Logs**: Scrollable terminal-style log output of `npm install` and `npm run setup` with timestamps, step completion indicators, database migration/seeding success markers
- **Health Checks**: 4-panel verification suite matching the client's own checklist: (1) Site password gate, (2) Login page, (3) AI generation call, (4) DOCX export — each with status, response time, last checked timestamp, and run check button
- **Deployment History**: Timeline of deployments with duration, status, commit ref, triggered-by

### Portfolio Project Selection Rationale

1. **eBay Pokemon Monitor (#23)** — Primary pick for "API/integration monitoring" pattern: watches a live API, displays real-time status, sends alerts. Closest structural analog to a deployment health monitor
2. **WMF Agent Dashboard (#1)** — Direct Anthropic Claude API experience. Client's app uses Claude API; this is the most relevant technology match. Shows Humam has shipped Claude API integrations to production
3. **Data Intelligence Platform (#18)** — Demonstrates deployment-ready SaaS with multi-source integration; communicates architectural maturity
4. **Auction Violations Monitor (#19)** — Monitoring dashboard with status tracking and verification workflows; domain-adjacent (compliance monitoring) and compositionally close to a deployment status dashboard

### Budget Signal Assessment

Budget is $200-$500 fixed price. This is at the edge of the hard filter ($500+). However:
- The scope is extremely well-defined (deploy + verify, 2-4 hours actual work)
- The client included Dockerfile, railway.toml, render.yaml — they are ready to go
- The NDA/non-compete requirement signals serious intent and a real project
- The task is genuinely narrow (no code changes, no CI/CD, no Kubernetes)

Recommendation: Proceed with the build. The demo demonstrates Humam can do the work and understands Railway/Node.js deployment conventions. The cover letter should include a "Done =" acceptance statement to reduce perceived risk.

### Cover Letter Variant: A ("Built It Already")

Variant A is correct because:
- The scope is crystal clear — no ambiguity requiring a "quick question" hook (Variant D)
- No existing system to redesign (Variant E)
- No single extreme pain point to lead with over the demo link (Variant B)
- No single portfolio project that is an exact match to override with Variant C

The demo link should appear in sentence 2, describing it as a "deployment verification dashboard" — matching the client's exact operational vocabulary.

### Screening Answer Strategy

All 4 screening questions must be answered. The first question (platform recommendation) is the highest-leverage one — it's a test of technical judgment. The answer must:
1. Recommend Railway (they already have railway.toml — recommending something else would be odd)
2. Give a specific technical reason (single-process Express + SQLite = Railway's sweet spot)
3. Note the Render fallback with a concrete reason (volume pricing)
4. Reference the demo link

The NDA/non-compete confirmation answer should be brief, direct, and explicit — not hedged. The client included it as a trust signal; match it with equal directness.

### "Done =" Acceptance Statement

Include in cover letter or screening answers:

> Done = site password gate responds with 200 at /, login authenticates, one bill draft generation completes with DOCX download, all env vars set and documented in handoff notes, local copy deleted and confirmed.

This maps directly to the client's own 4-point verification list from the job post.

## Cover Letter Draft (for Cover Letter Writer)

> Deployment is the one step that can stall a 14,000-line codebase that's otherwise ready to ship — built a verification dashboard to show my approach: {VERCEL_URL}
>
> The demo covers the full checklist: env var configuration, npm run setup log, and the 4-point verification suite (password gate, login, AI generation, DOCX export). I've deployed Claude API apps to production and know the exact env var configuration that trips most Railway first deploys.
>
> Done = password gate live, one bill draft generated with DOCX download, all vars documented, local copy deleted.
>
> Does the existing railway.toml already specify the DATABASE_PATH for the persistent volume, or is that one that needs to be set at deploy time?
>
> Humam

Word count: ~110. Under 120-word limit. Does not start with "I". Demo link in sentence 1-2. Embedded question specific to their job post. Done statement included. Binary CTA should be added by Cover Letter Writer.

## Flags for Downstream Agents

### For Layout Builder
- Aesthetic: `data-dense`
- Color: indigo `oklch(0.52 0.14 260)` — slightly reduced chroma
- Radius: `0.25rem` (sharp, per data-dense spec)
- Borders: full-opacity `border-border`
- Motion: 50-100ms (instant/snappy per data-dense spec)
- Density: compact — `--page-padding: 0.75rem`, `--card-padding: 0.75rem`
- Typography: Geist Sans + Geist Mono; monospace for ALL values (deployment IDs, timestamps, env var names, response times)
- Sidebar width: `14rem` (slim, per data-dense spec)
- No shadows, no decorative animation, no rounded cards

### For Dashboard Builder
- Dashboard pattern: Ops command center — status grid at top, env var checklist mid-section, health check results bottom
- Do NOT use a generic 4+1+1 layout
- KPI cards: compact, monospace values, semantic status color (green = live, red = failed, amber = pending)
- No gradient cards — flat, bordered, dense
- Chart: 30-day deployment history as a compact timeline/bar chart, NOT a revenue trend

### For Data Architect
- Generate 15-20 deployments with realistic IDs (deploy-a1b2c3 format), durations (45-180s), statuses
- Generate env var table with 12 variables matching .env.example vocabulary (ANTHROPIC_API_KEY, SESSION_SECRET, SITE_PASSWORD, DATABASE_PATH, NODE_ENV, PORT, etc.)
- Include edge cases: 2 deployments marked Failed (one due to missing env var, one due to health check timeout), 1 deployment marked Rolled Back
- Health check log entries with realistic response times and HTTP status codes
- Setup log entries from npm install and npm run setup with timestamped lines

### For Feature Builder
- Feature pages: Env Config, Setup Logs, Health Checks, Deployment History
- All use domain vocabulary from vocabularyMap above
- Health Checks page is the highest-priority feature — it directly mirrors the client's 4-point acceptance checklist (password gate / login / AI generation / DOCX export)
- Setup Logs page should render as a terminal-style scrollable log (dark background, monospace, timestamp prefix per line)

### For Challenges Builder
- 3 challenges (this is a well-specified technical job — 3 is appropriate, not 2 or 4)
- Challenge titles use pain vocabulary: "env var propagation", "SQLite persistence across restarts", "verification before handoff"
- Each challenge connects directly to something stated in the job post — no domain-generic challenges
- Outcome statements use qualifier language ("Could eliminate...", "Could prevent...", "Could verify...")

### For Proposal Builder
- Hero value prop: "Full-stack developer who deploys Node.js applications to Railway and verifies them end-to-end — including Claude API integrations, SQLite persistence, and session-based auth."
- Feature "How I Work" for deployment jobs: Receive Access -> Configure & Deploy -> Verify Checklist -> Document & Handoff
- Skills grid: Node.js, Express, Railway, Render, Docker, SQLite, Anthropic Claude API, Git, Linux, Environment Configuration
- Do NOT include frontend skills (Next.js, React, Tailwind) as primary — this is a backend/DevOps job

### For Cover Letter Writer
- Use variant A
- Include the "Done =" statement
- Embedded question: DATABASE_PATH persistent volume question (see draft above)
- Tone: professional, direct, technically specific — matches client's organized, structured writing style
- Avoid: any mention of "dashboard" without the word "deployment" or "verification" — keep context clear
- Binary CTA: "Happy to jump on a call or send the Railway deploy steps as a quick Loom — your pick."
